            To a certain extent, there's a limit to what company executives can
            control. They can put in place an expert sales and marketing team.
            They can ensure the product or service is top notch and tailored
            perfectly towards the target demographic.

            But at the end of the day, the market is going to have the final say
            on how that transitions to revenue and profits. Every industry goes
            through ups and downs, on both a market segment and macroeconomic
            level.

            CEOs, CFOs and other senior executives can't influence the wider
            economy, but what they can control is expenses. That's why, when it
            comes to projecting the future financial performance of a company,
            expense forecasting is a powerful tool that's worth taking the time
            to get right.

            Having a clear and consistent projection on the company's costs will
            allow a far better understanding of how the business can be expected
            to perform through all stages of the market cycle.
          </p>

          <p>
            That makes for more accurate projections, and ultimately, better
            business decisions.

              What Is an Expense Forecast?
            </h2>
            <p>
              An expense forecast is simply a projection of your future company
              costs. While the concept is fairly straightforward, the
              practicalities of actually putting together an accurate forecast
              are more complex than it can first appear.
            </p>
            <p>
              That being said, building an accurate and usable forecast is
              critical for any type of business, but especially for SaaS
              startups. They're so important, in fact, that we have a term for
              it: burn rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you have a clear view of your burn rate, you have a clear
              view of the length of your cash runway. The goal is to line up
              expenses with natural revenue growth and funding roads so that you
              can reach your end goalâ€”profitability. Expense forecasts can be
              used to find obvious (and not so obvious) areas where spend can be
              reduced and the length of your cash runway optimized to promote
              sustainable growth.

              Why Is Expense Forecasting Important?
            </h2>
            <p>
              It goes without saying the economy has been tough these past few
              years. Things have been unpredictable, and we've seen huge market
              shifts. The unfortunate truth is that 90% of startups fail. So,
              understanding your burn rate is crucial.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even successful startups have had to resort to mass layoffs.
              Though things seem to be slightly improving, there's still a lot
              of hesitation. That being said, startups can still find success if
              they plan. That requires a clear view of your cash burn rate and
              how that relates to revenue growth.
